# Scenario: Predicting Employee Salary Based on Multiple Factors

# A company wants to predict employee salary based on several important factors:

# Years of Experience

# Education Level (1 = Bachelor, 2 = Master, 3 = PhD)

# Number of Skills Known

# Performance Rating (1 to 5)

# Since salary depends on multiple variables, the company uses Multiple Linear Regression.

# Salary=b0​+b1​(Experience)+b2​(EducationLevel)+b3​(Skills)+b4​(Performance)
